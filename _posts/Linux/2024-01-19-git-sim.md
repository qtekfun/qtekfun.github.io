I've just discovered a tool called [Git-Sim](https://github.com/initialcommit-com/git-sim) that seems to be marvellous when you doubt about running a cgit command.

## How to install `git-sim`?

Well it's a little bit tricky so, in my case, for Fedora the steps are:

First enable rmp-fussion if you donÂ´t have it. Check my [Fedora first steps](/_posts/Linux/2024-01-07-first-time-in-fedora.md) for that.

``` bash
sudo dnf install libtiff-devel libjpeg-devel openjpeg2-devel zlib-devel \
    freetype-devel lcms2-devel libwebp-devel tcl-devel tk-devel \
    harfbuzz-devel fribidi-devel libraqm-devel libimagequant-devel libxcb-devel \
    cairo-devel pango-devel python3-devel ffmpeg
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip Pillow
pip3 install manim
pip3 install git-sim
```

With that it shoud work.

## How `git-sim` works?

Basically you run `git-sim` instead `git` and it will generate a picture of the simulation for you. Let's see an example:

If I run `git-sim clone https://github.com/qtekfun/qtekfun.github.io.git`

where you can see the operation drew.

Happy gitting!
