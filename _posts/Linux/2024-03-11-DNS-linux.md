This is a basic thing that it's normally working *Out-of-the-box but* that sometimes it doesn´t work. Today is one
of that days.

## How to detect it?

In my case it was because Ubuntu doesn't let me to update apt cache:

![apt cache can´t be updated](/assets/Linux/apt-cache-failed.jpg)

So, how to fix it?

## Edit the default DNS

To do that is as easy as run `sudo vim /etc/resolv.conf` and change the file to:

``` bash
# This file was automatically generated by WSL. To stop automatic generation of this file, add the following entry to /etc/wsl.conf:
# [network]
# generateResolvConf = false
#nameserver XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
nameserver 9.9.9.9
~
```

As an example I'm using the [Quad9](https://www.quad9.net/) DNS but you can choose the one you want.

And as easy as that, you will have the domain resolution working.
