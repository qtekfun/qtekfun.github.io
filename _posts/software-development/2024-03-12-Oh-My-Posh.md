I've just have enough time to play around with [Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/) and I love it. This is another
installation guide in Windows for my future records.

## Install Oh My Posh

You need to install it or from Microsoft store or by winget:

``` bash
winget install JanDeDobbeleer.OhMyPosh -s winget
```

You will need to **restart** your terminal to reload environment vars.

## Upgrade Oh My Posh

Same than before:

``` bash
winget upgrade JanDeDobbeleer.OhMyPosh -s winget
```

## Use Oh My Posh

Edit your `$PROFILE` and add the following:

``` bash
oh-my-posh init pwsh | Invoke-Expression
```

## Install Oh My Posh fonts

To do that just run:

``` bash
oh-my-posh font install --user
```

And install `Cascadia Code`

Then we need to configure it.

### Configure it in Windows Terminal

On Windows Terminal push `CTRL + SHIFT + ,` and then in the `seting.json` include:

``` json
{
      "profiles": {
        "defaults": {
            "font": {
                "face": "CaskaydiaCove Nerd Font Mono"
            }
        }
      }
}
```

### Configure it in Visual Studio Code

Open `setings.json` with `CTRL + ,` and then include in the user one:

``` json
"terminal.integrated.fontFamily": "'CaskaydiaCove Nerd Font Mono'"
```

## Install Oh My Posh's theme

To do that just run:

``` bash
Get-PoshThemes
```

Then you will need to include in your `$PROFILE` something like:

``` bash
oh-my-posh init pwsh --config 'C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Programs\oh-my-posh\themes\montys.omp.json' | Invoke-Expression
```

## Color folders

There is one more touch very interesting. Install:

``` bash
Install-Module -Name Terminal-Icons -Repository PSGallery
```

And then include in `$PROFILE` this:

``` bash
Import-Module -Name Terminal-Icons
```

## Posh Git

Another good thing to have is `Posh-Git` module. To do that:

``` bash
Install-Module Posh-Git
```

And then include in `$PROFILE` this:

``` bash
Import-Module Posh-Git
```

And with that in place, you're rocking!
