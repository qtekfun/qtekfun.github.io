One of the most asked questions in the interviews for new possitions regarding C++ are the Design patterns. It's a
topic that I've used a lot but I donÂ´t have in my mind a good idea about it. Until today. This is the solution for
that.

## Kinds of design patterns

First of all we need to know that there are three kinds of design patterns depending on the matter you are focused
on. The existing ones are:

* Creational patterns
* Structural patterns
* Behavior patterns

A good place to have more info is [Refactoring guru](https://refactoring.guru/es/design-patterns/cpp) but I will
dive a little bit more on this different types of patterns.

### Creational patterns

This ones are focused on how to create objects. The most common ones are:

* Abstract Factory
* Builder
* Factory Method
* Prototype
* Singleton

### Structural patterns

This ones are regarding the data structure of the objects

* Adapter
* Bridge
* Composite
* Decorator
* Facade
* Flyweight
* Proxy

### Behavior patterns

This ones are focused on the things that the objects can do during its life cycle:

* Chain of Responsibility
* Command
* Iterator
* Mediator
* Memento
* Observer
* State
* Strategy
* Template Method
* Visitor

As you can see, there are a lot of them. Read the details of them [here](https://refactoring.guru/es/design-patterns/cpp)
